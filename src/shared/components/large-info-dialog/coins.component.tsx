    <p>
      The Coins Indicator tracks the price movements of a selection of cryptocurrencies, chosen
       based on market capitalization and trading volume. It connects to a pre-configured exchange
        in real-time and analyzes price data for
         both <strong>COIN/BTC</strong> and <strong>COIN/USD</strong> pairs
          within a dynamic moving window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the Window Indicator, the Coins Indicator calculates a "state" for each coin, but
       it focuses on a shorter time frame, using approximately 40 minutes of historical data
        compared to the Window Indicator's 32-hour window. This allows Balancer to monitor the
         flow of capital across the entire cryptocurrency market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Reversal Indicator</strong> leverages these calculated states to assess the
       overall market direction and identify potential price reversals.
